    <h1>LAST BLOOD FOR MUSE</h1>
    <p>adorned lucien, kindly takes away your life<br>
deconstructs your inmost fears and old deals<br>
and misters, they called me to rise at dawn<br>
extremely loud sound of wishes left me hung<br>
them the tears, i could be the one to blame<br>
give all my understandings to weak ghost's flame<br>
<br>
the time has come, what used to shout in my head<br>
appear in the cloth of colors, like usual surroundings<br>
after a painless struggle you'll be the jewel, for the glory<br>
of your loved ones' death, somehow i kept my mouth shut<br>
now stand, see them pass by, at this threaten night<br>
rebuild your hardened mind and i will take away the might<br>
behind those which store the dissatisfaction of spirits<br>
how can we hide heartlessly behind our rigorous words?</p>
