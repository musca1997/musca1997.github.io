 Fiddling around with the aesthetic of oldshool CRT displays. Some elements to give a good dirty cyberpunk aesthetic: a simple flickering animation intended to be ambient but not too annoying, scanlines and an unapologetically imprecise pixel font... all in a nice responsive container that should fit pretty much any screen form factor. Could be especially fun as a theme for a text adventure game.
