## Himizu Manga Review

I finished this manga in 3hours, here's my opinion. (Here will be spoilers, be careful.)

In my opinion it's actually about a point of view about fatalism, which links closely to Japanese culture.

<!--more-->

It's about a teen who was born in a poor family whose father was in debt and ran away, and then his mother eloped with her new boyfriend. The main character's dream was to be a simple and common person, but he found it really hard for him after one day he killed his father. After that he was always in a suicidal state, and also want to kill people who also killed people. And finally it led to his own suicide.

But personally I don't think the tragedy was the author's main idea, also I don't think it's about stuff like novel No Longer Human, I think it's mainly about fatalism as the universe was mentioned in book. The beginning of the manga talked about amount of the non-normal death caused in Japan, so I think the author himself was emphasizing the fate.

When logically death and life are both meaningless, some people would commit suicide because they take it as a meaningful thing, as it's the last battle between human and meanings. So we can say that nihilist wouldn't suicide. The main character though seemed empty and nihilistic but he was definitely not a nihilist. He was just a simple teenage, like those we can see in our life. They're afraid of growing up to be an ugly adult, becoming numb. Their views change all the time. This character was real with fleshes. What he did was just what his personality would lead him to.

Why would I think it's a manga about fatalism? Just pay a attention to the ugly creature in some pages, it always talked to the main character when he woke up in the midnight, and also was not far away from him when he committed suicide. I think that creature was actually the figurative image of fate, it got into his life and always used its thoughts to change the actions of the main character, we can take it as a "tendency".

I don't think he's cowardly or something, as the universe created in this manga used a system of fate, he has already tried his best to avoid it. He has already asked for help and struggled just to be a simple and common person, but he still failed because the thing he fought with was the fate.

## 其实这漫画用“宿命论”也能解释得通


   无聊开了一下脑洞，似乎也能解释得通，所以记下来留着给自己以后看，您可以点没用。

   表面上看这是一个出生于不幸家庭的男主遇到了接连不断的糟糕的事情，又因为杀父一事违背了自己成为“庸才”（漫画中是一个中性词）这一准则，一直处于求死状态中（外化为想要杀死其他坏人，内化为想要自杀），最后自杀的故事。

   但我个人认为作者并不是在着重刻画小人物的悲剧，也不是在刻画叶藏式人物。从他在漫画后面主人公看书谈及“宇宙”来看，我认为他更多地是想强调宿命论的命运观（也是日本人很喜欢的套路~），而非主人公所体现的意志。漫画一开头就提及日本每天非正常死亡人数，所以我代入宿命论看完了整个漫画。

   当生与死都无法解决无意义这个问题，自杀便是对无意义作出的最后一次冲击，因为它把主动选择死亡当做有意义，故虚无主义者是不会自杀的。看到有书评说主人公是虚无主义者，我必须得否认。主人公三观的设定实际上很真实、很生活化，不是任何主义，这是一个典型的三观未成形的不断探索怀疑的青春期少年的形象，害怕变成麻木而丑陋的成人，害怕为了偷生而苟活，他的观点也时常发生变化，我们生活中可以看到很多这样的年轻人，只是他的家庭状况比我们大部分人都要悲惨很多，故而容易引向种种空虚、悲观、刻薄的观点。我们可以说他所做的一切都是带有他性格色彩的个人意志的体现，比如杀死和他一样的“白痴”，带一点芥川龙之介气息，比如“人生只有一张王牌，自杀”，然而他的背后却是一个带着宿命论体系的世界。

   为什么我会觉得这个漫画和宿命论有很大关联？因为漫画里时常出现一个丑陋的怪物，我认为这是命运在主人公生活中具象化的一个形象，它是主导主人公做出各种举动的“倾向”，所以它时常会在半夜出现同主人公进行对话，改变他的看法，并在他自杀前再次出现。

   我并不觉得主人公如很多评论所说，是一个消极回避的懦弱的人。他虽然看似一心求死，但实际已经在命运压迫之下，在限定范围里发出了许多求救信号，并时常矛盾着。然而，当一个宇宙的体系由命运二字贯穿之时，广义上的和狭义上的外力都是占了压倒性作用的，除了尽可能回避外，只有不越界地进行微小的抗争。

   他毕竟不是“庸才”的命，而是故事一早课堂上谈及的日本每天非正常死亡的XXXXX人，于是终究还是没能因个人意志成为一个“庸才”。
